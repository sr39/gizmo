%----  This is an example parameter file like the included "params.txt"
%       for GIZMO, showing an example set of CHIMES parameters added.
%       (all the other parameters need to be added too -- this is just
%        an example of the CHIMES-specific 'block')
%       See the CHIMES-specific readme for more details of the additions
