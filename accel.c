/*! \file accel.c
 *  \brief driver routines to carry out force computation
 */


/*! This routine computes the accelerations for all active particles.  First, the gravitational forces are
 * computed. This also reconstructs the tree, if needed, otherwise the drift/kick operations have updated the
 * tree to make it fullu usable at the current time.
 *
 * If gas particles are presented, the `interior' of the local domain is determined. This region is guaranteed
 * to contain only particles local to the processor. This information will be used to reduce communication in
 * the hydro part.  The density for active SPH particles is computed next. If the number of neighbours should
 * be outside the allowed bounds, it will be readjusted by the function ensure_neighbours(), and for those
 * particle, the densities are recomputed accordingly. Finally, the hydrodynamical forces are added.
 */

/*
 * This file was originally part of the GADGET3 code developed by
 * Volker Springel. The code has been modified (re-arranged, consolidated, and a number of additional
 * sub-loops and other structures for e.g. feedback, gradients, neighbor operations on non-gas, etc,
 * added) by Phil Hopkins (phopkins@caltech.edu) for GIZMO.
